We need to look for an answer choice that explains a desirable aspect of having a large house.\n\n3. Let's evaluate the choices:\n   (a) \"have choice\" - doesn't directly relate to house size\n   (b) \"mentally challenged\" - not relevant to wanting a large house\n   (c) \"own house\" - this is about ownership, not size\n   (d) \"obesity\" - not related to house size\n   (e) \"lots of space\" - this directly explains why someone would want a large house\n\n4. \"Lots of space\" is the most logical reason for wanting a large house. People like large houses because they provide more room for living, storing belongings, having separate areas for different activities, etc.\n\n5. Therefore, the answer is (e) lots of space.\n\nThe answer is (e)."

Looking at the answer choices:\n(a) satisfaction\n(b) complications\n(c) train\n(d) feel good about yourself\n(e) enjoyment\n\n4. Words like \"satisfaction\" and \"enjoyment\" both capture the positive feeling of helping people.\n\n5. However, \"satisfaction\" is the most precise term that describes the sense of fulfillment from helping others.\n\n6. \"Feel good about yourself\" is close, but it's not as concise as \"satisfaction\".\n\nTherefore, the answer is (a) satisfaction.\n\nThe reasoning is that when someone enjoys helping people, they typically feel a sense of satisfaction from their good deeds."

Looking at the answer choices:\n(a) bathroom - this is a specific room in his own living space\n(b) motel room - this is a temporary place\n(c) nearest public restroom - this is a shared, public facility\n(d) house - this is his own living space\n(e) apartment - this is also his own living space\n\n4. Since Billy wants to use his own toilet, the best answer would be either \"house\" or \"apartment\".\n\n5. Between these two, \"house\" seems to be the more specific and comprehensive term.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (d) house.\n\nThe key reasoning is that Billy wants to use his own toilet, and a house represents his personal living space where he would have his own, private bathroom."

Therefore, the answer is (e) paralysis.\n\nThe answer is (e).\n\nThe reasoning is that while fights, drunkenness, staggering, and puking are typical and expected side effects of being inebriated, paralysis is extremely rare and not a normal consequence of drinking alcohol."
