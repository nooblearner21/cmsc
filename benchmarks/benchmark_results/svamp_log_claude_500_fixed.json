Since each basket has 7 peaches, and the total number of peaches is also 7, this means there is only 1 basket.\n\nThe answer is 1 basket.\n\nTo verify:\n* 1 basket has 4 red peaches and 3 green peaches\n* Total peaches = 4 + 3 = 7\n* Number of baskets = 7 peaches \u00f7 7 peaches per basket = 1 basket",
        "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. Each basket contains:\n   * 4 red peaches\n   * 3 green peaches\n   * Total of 7 peaches per basket\n\n2. We are told there are a total of 7 peaches in all baskets.\n\n3. Since each basket has 7 peaches, and the total is also 7 peaches, there must be 1 basket.\n\nThe answer is 1. There is 1 basket of peaches."

Jessica must have added some roses and orchids to the vase.\n\n4. The difference between the original and current number of orchids is:\n   * 13 - 6 = 7 orchids added\n\n5. The difference between the original and current number of roses is:\n   * 3 - 9 = -6 roses (meaning 6 fewer roses)\n\n6. The question asks how many more orchids than roses are in the vase now:\n   * Current orchids: 13\n   * Current roses: 3\n   * Difference: 13 - 3 = 10\n\nThe answer is 10.

How many trees did the grove workers plant today?\nA: We start with 15 trees. Later we have 21 trees. The difference must be the number of trees they planted. So, they must have planted 21 - 15 = 6 trees. The answer is 6.\n\nQ: If there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?\nA: There are 3 cars in the parking lot already. 2 more arrive. Now there are 3 + 2 = 5 cars. The answer is 5.\n\nQ: Leah had 32 chocolates and her sister had 42. If they ate 35, how many pieces do they have left in total?\nA: Leah had 32 chocolates and Leah's sister had 42. That means there were originally 32 + 42 = 74 chocolates. 35 have been eaten. So in total they still have 74 - 35 = 39 chocolates. The answer is 39.\n\nQ: Jason had 20 lollipops. He gave Denny some lollipops. Now Jason has 12 lollipops. How many lollipops did Jason give to Denny?\nA: Jason had 20 lollipops. Since he only has 12 now, he must have given the rest to Denny. The number of lollipops he has given to Denny must have been 20 - 12 = 8 lollipops. The answer is 8.\n\nQ: Shawn has five toys. For Christmas, he got two toys each from his mom and dad. How many toys does he have now?\nA: He has 5 toys. He got 2 from mom, so after that he has 5 + 2 = 7 toys. Then he got 2 more from dad, so in total he has 7 + 2 = 9 toys. The answer is 9.\n\nQ: There were nine computers in the server room. Five more computers were installed each day, from monday to thursday. How many computers are now in the server room?\nA: There are 4 days from monday to thursday. 5 computers were added each day. That means in total 4 * 5 = 20 computers were added. There were 9 computers in the beginning, so now there are 9 + 20 = 29 computers. The answer is 29.\n\nQ: Michael had 58 golf balls. On tuesday, he lost 23 golf balls. On wednesday, he lost 2 more. How many golf balls did he have at the end of wednesday?\nA: Michael initially had 58 balls. He lost 23 on Tuesday, so after that he has 58 - 23 = 35 balls. On Wednesday he lost 2 more so now he has 35 - 2 = 33 balls. The answer is 33.\n\nQ: Olivia has $23. She bought five bagels for $3 each. How much money does she have left?\nA: She bought 5 bagels for $3 each. This means she spent 5 * $3 = $15 on the bagels. She had $23 in beginning, so now she has $23 - $15 = $8.

First, find how many crackers and cakes each friend will get:\n   - Crackers: 29 \u00f7 2 = 14.5 (but this doesn't make sense)\n   - Cakes: 30 \u00f7 2 = 15\n\n4. Since Matthew wants to give equal numbers, he will give 14 crackers and 15 cakes to each friend\n   (rounding down the crackers)\n\n5. The question asks specifically: How many cakes did each person eat?\n   - Each friend gets 15 cakes\n\nThe answer is 15."
