Since the problem states he gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes, this is not possible with the given numbers.\n\nThe problem as stated cannot be solved because Matthew cannot distribute the crackers and cakes equally among his 28 friends.\n\nThe answer would be: This problem cannot be solved with the given information."

We need to find the difference between baseball cards and Ace cards:\n\nB + A = 415 (total cards left)\n\nThe number of baseball cards left is 415 - A, and we know that B must equal 415 - A.\n\nNow, to find how many more baseball cards than Ace cards she has left, we need to consider that she initially had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards. \n\nIf she gave away cards but ended with 415 total, we need to look at the difference:\n\nInitially, she had 309 baseball cards - 356 Ace cards = -47 (which means she had 47 fewer baseball cards than Ace cards).\n\nIf she has more baseball cards now, we are looking for the difference in the new counts. \n\nHowever, without the exact new counts of baseball and Ace cards left, we cannot find the exact answer, but we know the count must be adjusted such that B - A is positive.\n\nTo get the exact answer:\n\nLet\u2019s say she gave away X baseball cards and Y Ace cards. Then we have:\n\n309 - X (baseball cards left) and 356 - Y (Ace cards left).\n\nWe also know:\n\n(309 - X) + (356 - Y) = 415,\nwhich leads to X + Y = 250 (total cards given away).\n\nTo find the difference B - A, we would need the specific values of the baseball and Ace cards left after giving some away, which we don't have.\n\nThus, the answer regarding how many more baseball cards than Ace cards she has cannot be determined without additional information.",
        "Nell originally had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards, which totals 309 + 356 = 665 cards. After giving some away, she has 415 cards left. Therefore, she gave away 665 - 415 = 250 cards. \n\nNow, we need to determine how many baseball cards and Ace cards she has left. Since she has 415 cards remaining but we don't know the breakdown, we can't directly find out how many more baseball cards than Ace cards she has without additional information.\n\nHowever, if we assume she still has the same ratio of baseball to Ace cards after giving some away, we can use her original numbers to get a rough estimate. Originally, she had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards. The difference was 356 - 309 = 47 more Ace cards than baseball cards.\n\nTo find how many more baseball cards than Ace cards she has after giving some away, we would need more specific information about how many of each type she gave away.

To find how many more children got off than got on:\n   39 (got off) - 24 (got on) = 15\n\nThe answer is 15. 15 more children got off the bus than those that got on.",
        "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. Initially, there were 23 children on the bus.\n\n2. At the bus stop, 24 children got on the bus.\n   So now there would be 23 + 24 = 47 children on the bus.\n\n3. After the bus stop, there are now 8 children on the bus.\n\n4. This means the number of children who got off the bus is:\n   47 - 8 = 39 children got off the bus.\n\n5. We know 24 children got on the bus.\n\n6. The difference between children who got off and got on is:\n   39 - 24 = 15 children\n\nThe answer is 15. 15 more children got off the bus than those that got on."

        "Marco and his dad initially collected 22 pounds of strawberries together. Marco's strawberries now weigh 36 pounds. Since Marco's original strawberries were part of the 22 pounds, we can find out how much his dad's strawberries weighed initially. \n\nLet\u2019s denote the dad's initial strawberries as X. So, we have:\n\nX + Marco's initial strawberries = 22\n\nNow, if Marco's strawberries weigh 36 pounds and he originally had some weight from the 22 pounds, we can calculate the weight of the strawberries that were originally Marco's. \n\nIf we denote Marco's original weight as M, then:\n\nX + M = 22\nM = 36 (Marco's current weight)\n\nTo find the dad's original weight, we can rearrange:\n\nX = 22 - M\nX = 22 - 36\nX = -14 \n\nThis suggests that Marco's original strawberries must have weighed less than 22 pounds, which means he must have started with 22 pounds and then gained weight. \n\nNow, with the additional 30 pounds found, we add that to the dad's original strawberries:\n\nDad's current strawberries = X + 30\n= -14 + 30 \n= 16\n\nSo, the dad's strawberries now weigh 16 pounds.

        "Marco and his dad initially collected 22 pounds of strawberries. If Marco's strawberries now weigh 36 pounds, that means he must have collected additional strawberries. Initially, Marco and his dad's strawberries combined weighed 22 pounds. Since Marco's strawberries weigh 36 pounds now, we can find out how much his dad's strawberries weigh.\n\nFirst, we know that the dad found an additional 30 pounds of strawberries. Let's denote the initial weight of the dad's strawberries as D.\n\nFrom the initial collection, we have:\nMarco's strawberries + Dad's strawberries = 22 pounds\nSo, if we say Marco's initial weight was M, we have:\nM + D = 22\n\nNow, if Marco's strawberries now weigh 36 pounds, we can say:\nM (initial) + additional strawberries = 36 pounds\n\nTo find out how many strawberries his dad has now, we need to determine how much of the original dad's strawberries remains after he found the extra 30 pounds. \n\nInitially, we can express the dad's strawberries as:\nD = 22 - M\n\nBut since we don't know M, we can't find a specific weight without more information. \n\nHowever, we know that the total strawberries now are:\nMarco's = 36 pounds\nDad's = D + 30\n\nSo, we can say:\nD + 30 = (22 - M) + 30\n\nSince we don't know M, we can't calculate the exact weight of the dad's strawberries now. However, if we consider that Marco had to have initially shared with his dad, we can only conclude that the dad's strawberries now weigh whatever was left from the initial total of 22 pounds plus the 30 pounds he found.\n\nThus, the dad's strawberries weigh:\nD + 30 = (22 - M) + 30\n\nSince we don't have M, we can't provide a numeric answer, but we know the dad's strawberries weigh 30 pounds more than whatever he initially had.",

So together they have:\n\n22 pounds + 30 pounds = 52 pounds of strawberries.\n\nNow we know Marco has 36 pounds, so we can find out how much his dad's strawberries weigh:\n\nTotal strawberries (52 pounds) - Marco's strawberries (36 pounds) = Dad's strawberries.\n\n52 - 36 = 16 pounds.\n\nSo, his dad's strawberries now weigh 16 pounds.

We know that now Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug:\n   \u2022 (x + 2) = (x - y) + 19\n\n6. Solve the equation:\n   \u2022 x + 2 = x - y + 19\n   \u2022 2 = -y + 19\n   \u2022 y = 17\n\n7. Doug lost 17 marbles.\n\nThe answer is 17.",
        "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. We know Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug at the beginning.\n\n2. After Doug lost some marbles, Ed now has 19 more marbles than Doug.\n\n3. This means the number of marbles Doug lost caused the difference between Ed and Doug to increase from 2 to 19.\n\n4. So the number of marbles Doug lost is the difference: 19 - 2 = 17.\n\nThe answer is 17. Doug lost 17 marbles.\n\nLet me walk through the logic:\n- Initially, if Doug had X marbles, Ed had X + 2 marbles\n- After Doug lost 17 marbles, he now has X - 17 marbles\n- Ed still has the same number of marbles: X + 2\n- Now the difference between them is 19\n- So (X + 2) - (X - 17) = 19\n- This confirms that Doug lost 17 marbles."
