If 10 is added to each number then the mean of the numbers is?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) 50\n(b) 45\n(c) 65\n(d) 78\n(e) 64\nA: If 10 is added to each number, then the mean of the numbers also increases by 10. So the new mean would be 50. The answer is (a).\n\nQ: If a / b = 3/4 and 8a + 5b = 22,then find the value of a.\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) 1/2\n(b) 3/2\n(c) 5/2\n(d) 4/2\n(e) 7/2\nA: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2.

The answer is (a).\n\nQ: If a / b = 3/4 and 8a + 5b = 22,then find the value of a.\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) 1/2\n(b) 3/2\n(c) 5/2\n(d) 4/2\n(e) 7/2\nA: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is (b).\n\nQ: A person is traveling at 20 km/hr and reached his destiny in 2.5 hr then find the distance?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) 53 km\n(b) 55 km\n(c) 52 km\n(d) 60 km\n(e) 50 km\nA: The distance that the person traveled would have been 20 km/hr * 2.5 hrs = 50 km.

The answer is (a).\n\nQ: If a / b = 3/4 and 8a + 5b = 22,then find the value of a.\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) 1/2\n(b) 3/2\n(c) 5/2\n(d) 4/2\n(e) 7/2\nA: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is (b).\n\nQ: A person is traveling at 20 km/hr and reached his destiny in 2.5 hr then find the distance?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) 53 km\n(b) 55 km\n(c) 52 km\n(d) 60 km\n(e) 50 km\nA: The distance that the person traveled would have been 20 km/hr * 2.5 hrs = 50 km.

In the first 2 hours, Hose A fills 2 * (1/8) = 1/4 of the pool.\n\n3. The remaining 3/4 of the pool is filled by both hoses together in 3 hours.\n\n4. Let's say Hose B's rate is 1/x of the pool per hour.\n\n5. In 3 hours, the combined rate of both hoses fills 3/4 of the pool.\n   So, (1/8 + 1/x) * 3 = 3/4\n\n6. 3/8 + 3/x = 3/4\n\n7. 3/x = 3/4 - 3/8\n   3/x = 3/8\n   x = 8\n\n8. Therefore, Hose B would take 8 hours to fill the entire pool working alone.\n\nThe answer is (a) 8.\n\nThe answer is 8."

If 10 is added to each number then the mean of the numbers is?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) 50\n(b) 45\n(c) 65\n(d) 78\n(e) 64\nA: If 10 is added to each number, then the mean of the numbers also increases by 10. So the new mean would be 50. The answer is (a).\n\nQ: If a / b = 3/4 and 8a + 5b = 22,then find the value of a.\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) 1/2\n(b) 3/2\n(c) 5/2\n(d) 4/2\n(e) 7/2\nA: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is (b).\n\nQ: A person is traveling at 20 km/hr and reached his destiny in 2.5 hr then find the distance?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) 53 km\n(b) 55 km\n(c) 52 km\n(d) 60 km\n(e) 50 km\nA: The distance that the person traveled would have been 20 km/hr * 2.5 hrs = 50 km.

The answer is (a).\n\nQ: If a / b = 3/4 and 8a + 5b = 22,then find the value of a.\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) 1/2\n(b) 3/2\n(c) 5/2\n(d) 4/2\n(e) 7/2\nA: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is (b).\n\nQ: A person is traveling at 20 km/hr and reached his destiny in 2.5 hr then find the distance?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) 53 km\n(b) 55 km\n(c) 52 km\n(d) 60 km\n(e) 50 km\nA: The distance that the person traveled would have been 20 km/hr * 2.5 hrs = 50 km.

At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?\\nAnswer Choices:\\n(a) 80\\n(b) 120\\n(c) 240\\n(d) 320\\n(e) 360",

The answer is (a).\n\nQ: If a / b = 3/4 and 8a + 5b = 22,then find the value of a.\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) 1/2\n(b) 3/2\n(c) 5/2\n(d) 4/2\n(e) 7/2\nA: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is (b).\n\nQ: A person is traveling at 20 km/hr and reached his destiny in 2.5 hr then find the distance?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) 53 km\n(b) 55 km\n(c) 52 km\n(d) 60 km\n(e) 50 km\nA: The distance that the person traveled would have been 20 km/hr * 2.5 hrs = 50 km.

    "prompt": "Q: John found that the average of 15 numbers is 40. If 10 is added to each number then the mean of the numbers is?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) 50\n(b) 45\n(c) 65\n(d) 78\n(e) 64\nA: If 10 is added to each number, then the mean of the numbers also increases by 10. So the new mean would be 50. The answer is (a).\n\nQ: If a / b = 3/4 and 8a + 5b = 22,then find the value of a.\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) 1/2\n(b) 3/2\n(c) 5/2\n(d) 4/2\n(e) 7/2\nA: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is (b).\n\nQ: A person is traveling at 20 km/hr and reached his destiny in 2.5 hr then find the distance?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) 53 km\n(b) 55 km\n(c) 52 km\n(d) 60 km\n(e) 50 km\nA: The distance that the person traveled would have been 20 km/hr * 2.5 hrs = 50 km.

If 10 is added to each number then the mean of the numbers is?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) 50\n(b) 45\n(c) 65\n(d) 78\n(e) 64\nA: If 10 is added to each number, then the mean of the numbers also increases by 10. So the new mean would be 50. The answer is (a).\n\nQ: If a / b = 3/4 and 8a + 5b = 22,then find the value of a.\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) 1/2\n(b) 3/2\n(c) 5/2\n(d) 4/2\n(e) 7/2\nA: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2.

The answer is (a).\n\nQ: If a / b = 3/4 and 8a + 5b = 22,then find the value of a.\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) 1/2\n(b) 3/2\n(c) 5/2\n(d) 4/2\n(e) 7/2\nA: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is (b).\n\nQ: A person is traveling at 20 km/hr and reached his destiny in 2.5 hr then find the distance?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) 53 km\n(b) 55 km\n(c) 52 km\n(d) 60 km\n(e) 50 km\nA: The distance that the person traveled would have been 20 km/hr * 2.5 hrs = 50 km.
