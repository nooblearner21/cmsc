Judith Sheindlin (Judge Judy) is a modern-day television judge.\n\nWhile both were involved in law and judging, they lived in very different eras and had quite different life experiences. Brackenridge was a pioneer in early American legal and educational systems, while Judge Judy is a television personality known for her no-nonsense courtroom style.\n\nGiven the significant differences in their backgrounds, time periods, and professional contexts, they would not have a great deal in common.\n\nThe answer is no."

He had one biological child, Caesarion, with Cleopatra, and possibly other children, but his genetic line did not spread as extensively.\n\nGiven the broader genetic spread of Genghis Khan's descendants, more people today are likely related to Genghis Khan than Julius Caesar.\n\nThe answer is yes."

Genghis Khan had many children and conquered vast territories, leading to widespread genetic propagation. Historical research suggests that a significant percentage of people in certain regions (particularly in Asia) are descended from Genghis Khan. Julius Caesar, while influential, did not have the same level of genetic spread. Therefore, more people today are likely related to Genghis Khan than Julius Caesar. The answer is yes."
